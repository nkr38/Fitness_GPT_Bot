# Fitness_GPT_Bot
This is a Telegram bot written in python that uses the OpenAI API to generate a workout and diet plan based off of the users input. The Telegram bot uses a step based approach to the conversation and includes buttons on some of the prompts.

## What you need to run:
- Install telebot and openai libraries.
- Create your own Telegram bot by messaging the "BotFather" on Telegram.
- Replace the Telegram and OpenAI API tokens with your own. (You will need a paid OpenAI account)
